Matchmaker is a discord bot made specifically for the Discord server: Dark and Darker Polska.
Its purpose WAS to manage matchmaking lobbies between players to connect them together in groups of 3 to play Dark and Darker.

Now its main features are: 
Menu of classes, where each class changes your name to the specified class

Currently working on a Real-Money-Trading system allowing players to trade their in-game items with other players for a real money profit.
Everyone can create a trading room with another player where they can talk about the trade.

The channel only activates when both people accept to open a trade channel.
You can also specify a Middleman for the trade to ensure safety of the transaction.
